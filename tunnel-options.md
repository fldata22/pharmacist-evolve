# üåê Website Tunneling Options for External Review

## Option 1: ngrok (Recommended - Already Set Up)

### Quick Start:

./tunnel-website.sh
```

### Manual Steps:
1. Start your servers: `./run-website.sh`
2. In a new terminal: `ngrok http 8002`
3. Share the https URL that appears

**Pros:** Free, reliable, HTTPS included, easy setup
**Cons:** URL changes each time (unless paid plan)

## Option 2: localtunnel (Alternative)

### Install and Use:
```bash
# Install localtunnel globally
npm install -g localtunnel

# Start your servers
./run-website.sh

# In new terminal, create tunnel
lt --port 8002 --subdomain pharmacist-evolve-demo
```

**Pros:** Free, can request custom subdomain

## Option 3: Cloudflare Tunnel (Free & Professional)
